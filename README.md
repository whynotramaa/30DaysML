# 30 Days of ML Sprint

This repository documents a 30-day Machine Learning sprint based on the **CampusX 100 Days of Machine Learning** playlist.
The focus is consistency, core ML concepts, and small hands-on projects.

## What’s inside
- Daily notes and topic summaries
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- Small toy projects to apply concepts
- Checkpoints to revisit intuition and math

## Source Material
CampusX – 100 Days of Machine Learning (YouTube)

## Repository Structure
- `notes.md` daily learning logs
- `trial.ipynb` experimentation notebook
- `toyProj001.py` quick practice scripts

## Goal
Build strong ML fundamentals in a focused 30-day window and create momentum for deeper ML work.
