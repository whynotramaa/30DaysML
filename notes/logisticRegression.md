## Logistic Regression
<!-- PreRequisute -->
- linearly ( / almost ) seperable
- we have Ax+By+C = 0 line not y = mx + c as it follws general equation

#### Perceptron Trick
    what changes in A,B,C causes what ?
    how we change A,B,C according to the point ?
    coef = old coeff - learning_rate * co-ordinates
    or
    wt = wt + learning_rate * (y[j] - y_hat) * x[j]
    algortihm

    problems in perceptron trick

### Sigmoid Function

### Probablistic definition

### maximum likelihood and why not product ?

#### cross entropy and loss function

### final formulation and code implementation with explanation of what we are doing
