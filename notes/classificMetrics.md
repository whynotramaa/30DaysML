### accuracy score and it's problems

### confusion matrix, acc. score with it and it's problems

##### Type 1 Error = False Postive and Type 2 Error = False Negative

### precision = TP/(TP+FP)

### recall = TP / (TP + FN)

#### how to choose ?


---

### f1 score = 2*(precision)*(recall) / precission + recall
    but why harmonic mean and not arthimetic mean ?

### multi-class precision and recall, accuracy and confusion matrix

### macro and weighted scores
